Cecog Analyzer Battery Package
============================================
This package provides demo data for the CecogAnalyzer. The repository is linked as a submodule to the main cecog repository.

Use

"git submodule init"
"git submodule update"

in the cecog repository to check out the demo data. You will find it in 

"apps/CecogAnalyzer/resources/battery_package"

Just running the CecogAnalyzer as an app will automatically load the demo config file, which is copied on demand into the application support folder of your os (e.g. ".../AppData/CecogAnalyzer1.5.0" for Windows 7)
